# whoampersandi

Whoampersandi is a console app RPG that started out as a fun way for me to learn C#, but has turned into an immensely large project.  For the time being, production is on hold, but you're welcome to clone it and run the app to get a feel for how the game will run.  The largest component yet to be built is some kind of battle system which will be turn-based, and probably mostly text-based.
