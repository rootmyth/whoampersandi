# whoampersandi

Whoampersandi is a top-down, console app RPG that started out as a fun way for me to learn C#, but has turned into an immensely large project.  For the time being, production is on hold, but you're welcome to fork it and run the app to get a feel for how the game will run.  The largest component yet to be built is some kind of battle system which will be turn-based, and probably mostly text-based.

If you'd like to check it out you can easily do so on Windows by forking the repo and running it as-is, but keep in mind that despite it currently clocking in at about 3,571 lines of code this is simply the foundation.  All of this nonsense was needed to create a world, a player in the world, and other entities and objects for the player to interact with.  Once the battle system is in place, further development will be a marathon of creating each area (of which there are planned to be 4,096) and watching the narrative come together.
